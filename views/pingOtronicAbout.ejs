<h3>What is PingOtronic</h3>
<p>This is a ping monitoring tools for debug network issue in complex network.</p>
<p>Targets will be pinged (icmp echo request & icmp echo response) using PingOtronc host's (the local linux debian machine running pingOtronic kit,no satellite & console yet) ping for packet size defined for each Host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pings will be at 1 second cadence.</li>
<li>Ping response are stored in local postgresql database.</li>
<li>1 minute is about 60 pings, 1 hour about 3600 and one day will be about 86400 ping for each host.</li>
<li>200 target mean more than 15 Milion of records each day.</li>
<li>200 target mean lot of traffic from your host to destination target, this may be a performance problem on low bandwith links</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why this name</h3>
<p>This is a tribute to the mid '70 console game. It was called Ping-o-tronic (https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping-o-tronic & https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping-O-Tronic).</p>
<p>There is nothing more than a tribute to that console, it was a game and pingOtronic is a network tools.</p>
<h3>How To</h3>
<p>After installation you may connect using a moderm web browser to address and port where applicaion is attached. Selecting "Manage HostFile" you can add/remove targets</p>
<p>Hosts list is read every 5 minutes on the clock</p>
<h3>Tobe Done</h3>
<p>Data Retention.... how long you want to keep your data in DB?</p>
<p>No page auth is set, it can be done, but it is not done. Plese ask for it if required!<p>
<p>At this moment PingOtronic do not clean & remove old records from DB, this will lead to problem and slow down web pages</p>
<p>Please fell free to consider max data retention removing data form DB tables and/or moving in separate tables</p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>Professional services for installation, turn-on key solution, authertication, add-on etc are available. Please contact us for discuss about this!.</p>
<h3>How is Done</h3>
<p>node+node-express+postgresql+mosquitto+bash script+crontab</p>
<ul>
<li>In a dedicate linux box (we use Debian)</li>
<li>cron execute every 5 minute a bash script</li>
<li>bash script kill al pings active and start new ones</li>
<li>Every ping pipe output to a mosquitto topic</li>
<li>one javascript script listen to mosquitto topic and save data</li>
<li>an other javascript script listen to mosquitto topics and rise error/save a record in case of ping is not replayed</li>
<li>a set of web pages running under Node/express give access to data</li>
<li>Users management pages and general layout was derived from <a href="https://raddy.dev/">Raddy TheBrand</a></li>
