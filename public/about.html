<h3>What is PingOtronic</h3>
<p>This is a ping monitoring tools for debug network issue in complex network.</p>
<p>Targets will be pinged (icmp echo request & icmp echo response) using PingOtronc host's (linux debian machine) (no satellite & console yet) ping for packet size defined for each Host.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pings will be at 1 second cadence.</li>
<li>Ping response are stored in local postgresql database.</li>
<li>1 minute is like to 60 pings, 1 hour 3600 and 1 day 86400 ping for each host.</li>
<li>200 target mean about 15 Milion of records each day.</li>
<li>200 target mean lot of traffic from your host to destination target, this may be a performance problem on low bandwith links</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why this name</h3>
<p>This is a tribute to the mid '70 console game. It was called Ping-o-tronic (https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping-o-tronic & https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping-O-Tronic).</p>
<p>There is nothing more than a tribute to that console, it was a game and pingOtronic is a network tools.</p>
<h3>How To</h3>
<p>After installation you may connect using a moderm web browser to address and port where applicaion is attached. Selecting "Manage HostFile" you can add/remove targets</p>
<p>Host file is read every 5 minutes on the clock</p>
<h3>Tobe Done</h3>
<p>Data Retention.... how long you want to keep your data in DB?</p>
<p>No page auth is set, it can be done, but it is not done. Plese ask for it if required!<p>
<p>At this moment PingOtronic do not clean & remove old records from DB, this will lead to problem and slow down web pages</p>
<p>Please fell free to consider max data retention removing data form DB tables and/or moving in separate tables</p>
